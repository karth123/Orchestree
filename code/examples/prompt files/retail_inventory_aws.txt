Cloud System Architecture Title: AWS-Powered Retail Inventory Management System

Brief Description:

This architecture outlines a modern and scalable retail inventory management system leveraging AWS's suite of services. The solution integrates real-time inventory tracking, demand forecasting, and supply chain optimization for large-scale retail operations.

Cloud Provider Selection:

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is selected as the cloud provider for its extensive range of compute, storage, and AI/ML services, ensuring scalability and security for global retail operations.

Cloud Resources:

Amazon EC2:

Hosts the core inventory management application.
Runs microservices for inventory tracking, pricing updates, and supply chain analytics.
AWS Elastic Load Balancing:

Distributes traffic across multiple EC2 instances.
Ensures high availability and fault tolerance.
Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service):

Manages structured inventory and sales data.
Provides secure and scalable database solutions with MySQL/PostgreSQL engines.
Amazon DynamoDB:

Stores unstructured data such as product metadata and transaction logs.
Offers high-speed and low-latency access for frequently queried data.
Amazon S3:

Stores product images, reports, and backup data.
Provides a scalable solution for unstructured data.
AWS Lambda:

Executes on-demand tasks like inventory reconciliation and low-stock alerts.
Integrates seamlessly with other AWS services for event-driven processing.
Amazon CloudWatch:

Monitors application performance and logs system activity.
Tracks KPIs like inventory turnover rates and sales forecasts.
Amazon API Gateway:

Manages secure API access for internal and external applications.
Enables integration with third-party services like suppliers and delivery systems.
AWS IAM:

Implements granular access control for system users.
Ensures security compliance for all resources.
Amazon SageMaker:

Builds and deploys ML models for demand forecasting and trend analysis.
Provides insights for inventory optimization.
AWS Wavelength:

Enhances performance for real-time inventory updates in retail stores.
Reduces latency for edge computing scenarios.
AWS Bottlerocket:

Runs containerized applications for supply chain microservices.
Simplifies management of lightweight compute environments.
AWS Elastic Fabric Adapter:

Optimizes high-performance computing (HPC) for complex inventory simulations.
Accelerates supply chain modeling and analysis.
AWS NICE DCV and NICE EnginFrame:

Provides remote visualization tools for dashboard analytics.
Facilitates collaborative planning across distributed teams.
Amazon Lightsail:

Supports small-scale stores or franchises with simplified compute and database hosting.
Resource Clustering and Grouping:

Application Processing Cluster:

Amazon EC2 and AWS Elastic Load Balancing: Manage the core application and ensure high availability.
Amazon DynamoDB: Powers real-time inventory lookups.
Data Storage and Backup Cluster:

Amazon RDS and Amazon S3: Store structured and unstructured data.
AI/ML Insights Cluster:

Amazon SageMaker and AWS Lambda: Provide intelligent analytics and automation.
Monitoring and Security Cluster:

Amazon CloudWatch and AWS IAM: Monitor and secure the system.
Edge Computing Cluster:

AWS Wavelength and AWS Bottlerocket: Power low-latency, edge scenarios in retail stores.
Relationships Between Resources and Clusters:

Application Processing Cluster:

EC2 processes incoming API requests routed via API Gateway.
DynamoDB provides product details for instant responses.
Data Storage and Backup Cluster:

RDS stores and retrieves transaction details.
S3 backs up historical data and media assets.
AI/ML Insights Cluster:

SageMaker analyzes past sales data stored in RDS to predict future trends.
Lambda triggers alerts for low inventory based on these forecasts.
Monitoring and Security Cluster:

CloudWatch aggregates logs and alerts administrators of anomalies.
IAM enforces access policies for system users.
Edge Computing Cluster:

Wavelength reduces latency for in-store inventory updates.
Bottlerocket runs containerized microservices for real-time applications.
